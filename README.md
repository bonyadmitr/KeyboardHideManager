### CocoaPods

```

<details>
<summary>Full CocoaPods Guide (click to expand)</summary>

[CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) is a dependency manager for Cocoa projects. You can install it with the following command:

```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

To integrate KeyboardHideManager into your Xcode project using CocoaPods, create file `Podfile` with content:

```ruby
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

target '<Your Target Name>' do
    pod 'KeyboardHideManager', '~> 1.0'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

Close 'Your Target Name'.**xcodeproj** and open 'Your Target Name'.**xcworkspace**.

</details>

### Carthage (not supported)

KeyboardHideManager cannot be used with Carthage in IB due `.framework` issue. Use CocoaPods or Manual install.

### Manually

> If you prefer not to use either of the aforementioned dependency managers, you can integrate KeyboardHideManager into your project manually.

Drag `KeyboardHideManager` folder in your project.

## Usage

- 1. Drag Object from Object library

- 2. Setup `KeyboardHideManager` in Class field

![usage_2](Resources/usage_2.png)

 - 3. Connect views with `targets`

![usage_3](Resources/usage_3.png)

## User Iteraction Enabled

Target must be `UIView` subclass and `user iteraction enabled` is on. You can set it in IB in View section: (example for UILabel)

![user_iteraction_enabled](Resources/user_iteraction_enabled.png)

or in code:

```swift
someView.isUserInteractionEnabled = true
```

## Xib support

To use with xib you must add strong property to controller:

```swift
@IBOutlet var keyboardHideManager: KeyboardHideManager!
```

> Otherwise it will be deinited. It is logic of Objects in xibs.
